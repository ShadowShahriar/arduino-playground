> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Arduino Playground** offers test code, templates, and experiments with well-known Arduino **sensors**, **peripherals**, and **displays** (like **OLED**, **TFT**, **LCD**, and **Dot Matrix**).
>
> While most installations and uses are straightforward, some require additional libraries and special wiring connections. I became confused while following numerous tutorials from blog posts, forums, and YouTube videos to set up these peripherals.
>
> So, I decided to document my process, including **the challenges I faced** and **the discoveries I made**. I also wrote some utility functions to solve common problems.
